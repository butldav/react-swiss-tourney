# Basic Tournament Manager in React

This app is a work in progress. It is my project assignment for the React section of the Frontend Developer Bootcamp at Promineo Tech. It meant to fulfill the following objectives:

- Use React Router and have at least 3 pages
- Use React Bootstrap or an alternative styling library
- Contain at least 10 components
- Allow for all CRUD operations using an online API of our choice.
